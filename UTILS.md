# CLI Utilities I Use

A simple reference list of tools I like to have installed. I install these manually depending on the environment.

## Core
- fzf — fuzzy finder
  - macOS (brew): `fzf`
  - Fedora (dnf): `fzf`
  - Debian/Ubuntu (apt): `fzf`
  - Post-install: run `$(brew --prefix)/opt/fzf/install` on macOS for keybindings/completions.

- bat — `cat` with syntax highlighting
  - macOS (brew): `bat`
  - Fedora (dnf): `bat`
  - Debian/Ubuntu (apt): `bat`

## Notes
- Keep this file as a living list; add package names if they differ by distro.
- Prefer installing via native package manager for updates/security.
